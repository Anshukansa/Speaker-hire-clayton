Speaker Hire Clayton - Landing Page
​A high-performance, narrative-driven landing page designed for Jayveer Tech.
​This project serves as a lightweight, fast-loading satellite site to capture local search traffic in Clayton, VIC and funnel users to the main business website. It utilizes a unique "book-style" copywriting strategy to engage visitors and encourages SMS-based bookings.
​📖 The Narrative Strategy
​Unlike standard rental listings, this page treats the event experience as a story:
​Chapter 1 (Prologue): Identifies the problem (bad audio ruining events).
​Chapter 2 (The Gear): Presents the solution (JBL PartyBox & PA Systems).
​Chapter 3 (Setting): Highlights the local advantage of Clayton (3168).
​Epilogue (Call to Action): Directs users to Text/SMS for immediate booking.
